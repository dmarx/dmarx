### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - I'm David! (He/Him)

Machine learning researcher / ML Engineer / Data Scientist / Statistician / Whatever-the-hell-we're-calling-my-"unicorn"-skillset-these-days.

Formerly at ![Microsoft WWL](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microsoft_WWL-258ffa?style=flat-square&logo=microsoft) and ![Amazon TRMS](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=flat-square&message=Amazon+TRMS&color=222222&logo=Amazon&logoColor=FF9900&label=). 

Currently taking a sabbatical to focus on my independent research. Open to contract/part-time opportunities (I could be convinced to take the right FT gig) and collaborations.
