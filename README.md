### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a machine learning researcher / ML Engineer / Data Scientist / Statistician / Whatever-the-hell-we're-calling-my-"unicorn"-skillset-these-days.

Formerly @Microsoft and @Amazon, taking a sabbatical to pursue independent research. Open to opportunities (primarily contract, but I could be convinced to take the right FT gig) and collaborations.
